    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks?
    </p>

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      [Standard hypertext transfer protocol, known as http, is written in clear
      text. This can be exploited by hackers who wants to steal sensitive
      information. I would recommend the client to use a secured hypertext
      transfer protocol, shortened to https. By doing this, the datas that is
      collected by http will be encrypted and unreadable when its being
      transferred over the internet between devices and severs. Using the
      protocol SSL, the website will have a certificate that identifies its
      authentic.
    </p>

    <p>
      To protect the users sensitive information, I would recommend implementing
      a session for expiration of user credentials. I would also recommend being
      restrictive regarding how much data is displayed and stored on the
      website. This to avoid sensitive data to be copied by a hacker and being
      used for other purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another advise would be to use strong passwords and set up a solution for
      secure authorisation for the site. This could be a two-factor
      authentication where the user must enter a password and a code sent to
      their phone or email. This will make it harder for intruders to attack the
      site.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure that everyone that works with the site is aware of the risks and
      threats that may arise, I would recommend including them in the safety
      practice. When more people are educated to be observant and feel
      responsible for safety, it could have a preventive effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would also recommend adopting automate and integrated security tools to
      ensure that the application security testing is done regularly.]
